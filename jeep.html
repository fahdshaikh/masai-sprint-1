            </div>

            <div class=" class5 class1 ">Jeep is a brand of American automobile and division of FCA US LLC (formerly Chrysler Group, LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Italian-American corporation Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Jeep has been a part of Chrysler since 1987, when Chrysler acquired the Jeep brand, along with remaining assets, from its previous owner American Motors Corporation (AMC).<br>
                Jeep's product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles – both cross-overs and fully off-road worthy models, including one pickup truck.<br>
                Words of the Fighting Forces by Clinton A. Sanders, a dictionary of military slang, published in 1942, in the library at The Pentagon gives this definition:
                Jeep: A four-wheel drive vehicle of one-half- to one-and-one-half-ton capacity for reconnaissance or other army duty. A term applied to the bantam-cars, and occasionally to other motor vehicles (U.S.A.) in the Air Corps, the Link Trainer; in the armored forces, the ½-ton command vehicle. Also referred to as "any small plane, helicopter, or gadget".

            <div class="class5 class1">I genuiely belive Jeep a robust, tough & an all-terrain car for daring & courageous people. And for Adventurer type people it is a perfect choice.<br>
               <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/541498-200.png" width="40px"> Adventurers always know just the compliment to soften a heart that’s getting ready to call their risks irresponsible or reckless.
